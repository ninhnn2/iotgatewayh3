	depends on PWM
	help
	  This option enables support for PWM driven monochrome LEDs that are
	  grouped into multicolor LEDs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called leds-pwm-multicolor.

config LEDS_QCOM_LPG

	depends on PWM
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  This option enables support for the Light Pulse Generator found in a
	  wide variety of Qualcomm PMICs. The LPG consists of a number of PWM
	  channels and typically a shared pattern lookup table and a current
	  sink, intended to drive RGB LEDs. Each channel can either be used as
	  a LED, grouped to represent a RGB LED or exposed as PWM channels.

	  If compiled as a module, the module will be named leds-qcom-lpg.
